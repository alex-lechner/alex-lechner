# Welcome to my engineering hub!

Hello and welcome! I'm Alex, an entrepreneur and passionate problem-solver.

As an engineer, I enjoy building technology, but I HATE it when nobody uses it (and if the design is ugly). That's why I work as a technical product consultant, assisting B2B tech startups in defining and selling their products. I bridge the gap between real painful customer problems, groundbreaking technology (developed from first principles, of course), and high-touch aesthetics. I strive to do what Apple (during the Steve Jobs Era) used to do, but in small :)

**My vision**
> Bring 23rd century innovation to the 21st century.

**My mission**
> Turn any **useful & crazy** idea into a business.

In the past, I've launched three ventures, with the most recent ones being:

**[lobi - lobi.ai](https://lobi.ai)**: lobi assisted Uber- and Bolt drivers to earn more money for each ride by predicting customer demand.

**[AIKONE - aikone.at](https://aikone.at)**: AIKONE assisted content creators in shifting from "brand promoters" to "brand owners" by designing, developing, producing, and scaling their sustainable fashion brands.

Aside from my work, I'm passionate about self-driving cars ðŸš—, aerospace ðŸš€, and music production ðŸŽµ.
